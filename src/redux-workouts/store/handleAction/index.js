/** After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a reducer function. */
/** Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. */
/**  It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects â€” it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. */
/** The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state. */
/** Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. */
/** Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, we are responsible for enforcing it in the code of our reducer functions.  */
